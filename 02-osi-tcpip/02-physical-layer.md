# 🔌 Physical Layer (Layer 1)

---

## 1. What It Does

The Physical Layer handles **raw bits** - converting 1s and 0s to electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves.

It's the actual **wires, cables, and hardware**.

## 2. Physical Media Types

| Medium | Type | Speed | Use Case |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| **Cat5e/Cat6** | Copper | 1-10 Gbps | Office/Home |
| **Fiber Optic** | Light | 100+ Gbps | Data centers |
| **WiFi** | Radio waves | Up to 10 Gbps | Wireless |
| **Coaxial** | Copper | ~1 Gbps | Cable internet |

## 3. Key Concepts

```
Signals:
├── Electrical (Ethernet cables)
├── Light (Fiber optic)
└── Radio (WiFi, Bluetooth)

Encoding: How 1s and 0s become signals
Bandwidth: How much data can flow (highway width)
Throughput: Actual data transferred (actual traffic)
```

## 4. Devices at Layer 1

- **Hubs**: Dumb repeaters (broadcast everything)
- **Repeaters**: Boost signal strength
- **Cables/Connectors**: RJ45, Fiber SC/LC
- **Network Interface Cards**: Hardware in your computer

```
Physical Layer = Raw bit transmission

Handles: Cables, signals, connectors, voltages
Devices: Hubs, repeaters, NICs
Protocols: Ethernet physical specs, WiFi standards

Layer 1 issues: Cable problems, signal interference
