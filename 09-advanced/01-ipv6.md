# 🌐 IPv6 Basics

---

## 1. Why IPv6?

IPv4: ~4.3 billion addresses (running out!)
IPv6: 340 undecillion addresses (basically infinite)

```
IPv4: 192.168.1.1
IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

---

## 2. IPv6 Format

```
Full:   2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Short:  2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

Rules:
├── 8 groups of 4 hex digits
├── :: replaces consecutive zeros
├── Leading zeros can be dropped
└── 128 bits total
```

---

## 3. IPv6 Types

```
Global Unicast:  2000::/3  (public, routable)
Link-Local:      fe80::/10 (local network only)
Loopback:        ::1       (like 127.0.0.1)
```

## 4. IPv4 vs IPv6

| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|---------|------|------|
| Length | 32 bits | 128 bits |
| Format | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| NAT | Required | Not needed |
| Security | Optional | Built-in |
| DHCP | Required | Optional |

## 5. Quick Summary

```
IPv6: Future of internet addressing

Benefits:
├── Unlimited addresses
├── No NAT needed
├── Built-in security (IPSec)
└── Simpler routing

Adoption: Growing, but IPv4 still dominant
Dual-stack: Most systems run both
```
